# What is ITM, ATM and OTM?

ITM stands for **in the money**, ATM stands for **at the money** and **OTM** stand for **out of the money**. These references are indicators of whether or not the option has reached the strike price \(ATM\), still needs to reach the strike price \(OTM\), or has already passed the strike price \(ITM\).

Using a Call option as an example, whether to buy an ITM, ATM, or OTM \(out of the money\) call is another decision you have to make because each of them responds differently to changing conditions.

An ITM option acts the most like a cryptocurrency position. Depending on how deeply it is ITM, it will act more and more like cryptocurrency. It will be affected less by time and changes in volatility, and more by the cryptocurrency price moving up and down. An ITM call may require a smaller rise in the cryptocurrency price to be profitable, but its percentage gains won't be as great as those of an ATM or OTM call.

An ATM option has the greatest uncertainty. It is the most sensitive to changes in the cryptocurrency price and volatility, and time passing. This can be good or bad. If all your speculations are wrong, the ATM option can hurt you the most.

An OTM option begs for a very large rise in the price of the cryptocurrency. If you get a big enough move in the cryptocurrency, an OTM call can deliver a much higher percentage profit than an ITM or ATM call. And if the cryptocurrency price falls dramatically, the loss on the OTM call will be smaller than on an ATM or ITM call. But remember that a big move in the cryptocurrency price is less likely than a smaller move, and OTM options will expire worthless if the move in the cryptocurrency isn't big enough.
