# Introduction

## About SIREN

Siren Markets (‘SIREN’) is focused on creating a high-quality, seamless experience for sophisticated users and requires no third-party settling mechanism or order matching to complete option settlement on chain.

The developers and designers at SIREN have been working on a protocol for decentralized options trading, and we’d like to share our thoughts on it with you here. Options are a financial primitive from which one can build many different more complex financial instruments. At their core, options give a trader the choice to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a known time in the future. This is useful for protecting yourself (a.k.a hedging) against possible price changes in the asset, as well as speculating on these price changes.
 
SIREN fills a unique market niche by catering specifically to sophisticated parties interested in holding and actively trading tokenized options contracts. Unlike any other cryptocurrency options platform, SIREN has tokenized both sides of an option contract, allowing for elements of an options ecosystem that can be traded as easily as a standard ERC-20. SIREN allows for both buyers and sellers to mint, buy, and trade in and out of options positions at any time.

In addition to our unique tokenization model, we have also separated our automated market making (AMM) layer from the settlement layer, which allows us to continuously modify the design of our market making, pool administration, and pricing as the trading volume and liquidity of our platform grows over time. Under this paradigm, a strategy that serves SIREN in our early stage of growth with a limited number of markets and available liquidity does not need to be the same strategy that serves during future high growth periods.

## Governance

There is a governance token for Siren Markets, called SIREN. This token allows holders to create new option markets, and determine the fee rate for writing, closing, and redeeming an option. These fees accrue to SIREN token holders. Upon launch these fees will be set to 0 to reduce the friction in using Siren options, but will likely increase if the DeFi community adopts Siren options.
